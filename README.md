Response: { "success": true, "photo": "imgbb-url", "description": "prompt" }
```

### Gallery
```
GET /api/v1/post
Response: { "success": true, "data": [posts] }

## 🔄 How the Dual-API System Works

1. **User submits prompt** → Client sends to backend
2. **Backend tries OpenAI first** → If successful, returns image
3. **If OpenAI fails** → Automatically switches to subnp.com
4. **Image downloaded** → Uploaded to imgbb for permanent hosting
5. **imgbb URL returned** → Displayed in gallery

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Reliability**: Works even if OpenAI is down
- ✅ **Cost-effective**: Free fallback option
- ✅ **No API keys needed**: subnp.com works without authentication
- ✅ **Quality**: Both APIs produce high-quality images
